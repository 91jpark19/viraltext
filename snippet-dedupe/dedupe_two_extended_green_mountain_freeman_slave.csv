3578,7907,1854-05-04-seq-2.txt,"been obtained without tho right to recover fugi tive slaves from tho part made free. Thus the three measures are one, and the Ordinance of "
3579,7908,1854-05-04-seq-2.txt,"1787 father to the other two. It led to tho adoption of tho fugitive slave clause in the Con stitution, and, we may say. to the formation of "
