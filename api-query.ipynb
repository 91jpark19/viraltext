Number 3\\nMAJOR LYNCH TAKES ISSUE\\nWITH CHICAGO TRIBUNE\\nTwo Classes Commercialize the Race\\nProblem.\\nChicago, 111. Thousands of the old\\ner generation of people, throughout\\nthe country, will remember the Hon.\\nJohn It. Lynch, as a part of the\\nsouth‚Äôs ‚ÄúReconstruction‚Äù period; as a\\nmember of Congress, for several\\nterms, from the state of Mississippi;\\nas the temporary chairman of a Na\\ntional Republican convention held in\\nChicago, many years ago; as a Re\\npublican leader of his home state,\\nMississippi, for many years, and iinal\\nly, as a major of the United States\\narmy until placed upon the retired\\nlist a year or two ago. Few men liv\\ning are so thoroughly capable and\\nsuch an authority on the subjects dis i\\ncussed in the following communica\\ntion to the Chicago Daily Tribune, as\\nis Major Lynch:\\nSpeaking of the photoplay called\\n‚ÄúThe llirth of a Nation,‚Äù the Tribune\\nsays:\\n‚ÄúIt is in all essential episodes\\ngrounded on historical fact, repre\\nsenting the struggles of that terrible\\ntime in the south when the whites,\\nback from war, saw their government\\ntaken over by the newly enfranchised\\nblacks controlled by the northern car\\npet baggers. What happened with the\\nNegro ascendant and how the white\\nre-established his supremacy is shown\\nwith obvious natural sympathy for the\\nsouth, and no doubt with such height\\nening of effect as dramatic art has a\\nright to employ. It pre lents what th<\\nsouth says and the north of our day,\\nat least, is inclined to believe to be\\nthe truth.‚Äù\\nexactly the reverse of this is true,\\nfor there never was a time when any\\none of the state governments of the\\nsouth was taken over by the newly\\nenfranchised blacks controlled by the\\nnorthern carpetbaggers. That some\\nmistakes were made during the prog\\nress of reconstruction will not be de\\nnied. How could it be otherwise? The\\nwar had just come to an end. Sec\\ntional animosity was bitter and in\\ntense. The Republican party was\\nlooked upon as the enemy of the\\nsouth. No white man could identify\\nhimself with the Republican party at\\nthat time in any one of the southern\\nstates without running the risk of be\\ning socially ostracised and publicly\\ncharacterized as an enemy to his sec\\ntion, his state, and his race. Notwith\\nstanding these things, not less than\\n25 per cent of the white men of that\\nsection men who were to the manor\\nborn, many of them, ex-Oon federate sole\\ndlers, identified themselves with and\\nbecame leaders of the Republican par\\nty. These, in the main, were the men\\nthat the newly enfranchised blacks\\nselected as their leaders and whose\\nleadership they loyally and faithfully\\nfollowed. I do not hesitate to assert\\nthat the reconstructed state govern\\nments at the south were the best gov\\nernments these states ever had before\\nThink on These Things\\n\"Smile awhile, for while you smile another smiles‚Äîand soon\\nthere‚Äôs miles and miles of smiles, and Life‚Äôs worth while because\\nyou smile.‚Äù\\nMAJOR JOHN ROY LYNCH, U. S. A.\\nor have ever had since. Tnere never\\nwas a time when there was actual\\nphysical \"Negro domination.\" or even\\ncarpetbag domination, in any one ol\\'\\nthe reconstructed states.\\nThe play to which you refer, instead\\nof being \"grounded on historical fact,‚Äù\\nis grounded on historical misrepresen\\ntation, without having a single actual\\nfact as the basis of its existence. It\\nis fiction pure and simple, painted\\nfrom a diseased and prejudiced imag\\nination, with a false and deceptive\\nbackground as a basis upon which to\\nstand. Such a play could not be oth\\nerwise than mischievous In its incep\\ntion and dangerous in its results, even\\nif the scenes depicted were a truth\\nful reproduction of actual occurrences.\\nBut when it is or ought to be a well\\nknown fact that the alleged scenes\\nire pure fabrications with not a sin\\ngle background of truth to support\\nhem, their production can hardly be\\nless than criminal. In the main they\\nare false, slanderous, and malicious.\\nThey are calculated and intended to\\nengender and intensify race preju\\ndice and race hatred. In the interest\\nof peace, order, truth, justice, and\\nmorality they should be suppressed.\\nNo good can come but much harm\\nmay result from them. It is, there\\nfore, the duty of the authorities to\\nsuppress them, just as they would\\nsuppress any other nuisance that is\\ncalculated to incite crime and general\\ndisorder in the community.\\nIn this connection allow me, as a\\nsouthern man, to say, and to say\\nwhereof I know, that there are just\\ntwo classes of white people at the\\nsouth who keep this so-caded race\\nproblem constantly before the public.\\nThe first class Is composed of those\\nwho commercialize race prejudice\\nsimply for the dollars and cents they\\n(Continued on third page)\\nAMERICAN CIVILIZATION\\nAGAIN IS DISGRACED\\nTwo Innocent Men Murdered by a\\nBlood-Thirsty Mob‚ÄîPonder\\nthe Facts.\\nMacon, Ga., July 9.‚ÄîThe hot-headed\\nspirit of the mob has again besmirch\\ned the state of Georgia. Silas Turner,\\na white planter of Gray, Ga., was\\nfound dead on Thursday at his farm\\nhome. Immediately, as is always tn<¬ª\\ncase, it was concluded that he had\\nbeen murdered by colored men. A\\nposse was immediately organized, and\\nsearch was instituted. Colored Amer\\nicans, of course, were their prey. Not\\n:\\'ar down the pike road leading to Ma\\ncon, Will Green and his son, a boy of\\n17 years, were encountered. Their\\ncolor was enough to prove their guilt.\\nThey were immediately ‚Äúroped‚Äù by\\nhe infuriated mob, and notwitlistand\\nng their pleadings and protests, they\\ntre strung up on the limb of a near\\nby tree and their bodies ribbled with\\nbullets. Contented with having aveng\\ned (?) the murder of their white\\nbrother the mob dispersed.\\nLynch Wrong Man.\\nAccording to information received\\nhere today, the authorities have made\\nan investigation and positively learn\\ned that Green and his son were inno\\ncent victims of the mob. It is said\\nthat they were at their home miles\\nfrom the scene of the murder whea K\\noccurred. Now suspicion has been di\\nrected to John Richey and Thomas\\nBrooks, whose whereabouts on the\\n(lay of the murder have not been sat\\nisfactorily accounted for by the au\\nthorities. This information has again\\naroused the mob spirit, notwithstand\\ning the accepted view that two inno\\ncent Americans have been executed\\nby the mob for the alleged murder.\\nGovernor Is Not Immune.\\nAt this writing the authorities are\\nundicided on the question as to wheth\\ner farmer Gray committed suicide or\\nmet his death by foul means.\\nMeanwhile the mob spirit is ram\\npant, and it is feared that if Richey\\nand Brooks are caught they will meet\\nthe same fate as did Green and his\\n17-year-old son.\\nVerily, Georgia, is cursed with the\\nspirit of the mob.

They certainly had reasons for such belief.\\nUnder these discouraging and deplorable conditions the\\nlaw-loving people of Newark struggled for relief. They\\nknew they could hope for nothing from those elected and\\nsworn to execute the law. A Law and Order League was\\nformed, and many cases found their way to the common\\npleas court, where sat Judge Seward, who administered\\njustice according to law and evidence. Several violators\\nwere punished and several of the near-beer joints were\\nabated as nuisances. Judge Seward is a resident of Newark,\\n<¬´*f|\\n'tsaz&k\\n‚ÄîOhio State Journal\\nand lie became a target for the saloon sympathizers. Beer\\nbottles were thrown through the windows of his residence,\\nand his home was stoned. Not an arrest was made and not\\nan officer was detailed to even make an investigation.\\nThe home of J. H. Miller, head of the Law and Order\\nLeague, was attacked and Mr. Miller was assaulted on his\\nown porch and severly injured. Other prominent ‚Äúdry‚Äù\\nworkers were threatened through the medium of cowardly\\nanonymous letters.\\nFinally, arrangements were made by the Law and Order\\nLeague and the Anti-Saloon League with a secret service\\ncompany of Cleveland, and several weeks ago this company\\nplaced some of its men in Newark to gather evidence against\\nthe saloonkeepers. When it was believed such evidence\\nhad been secured, arrangements were made for serving the\\nwarrants'. The necessary papers were obtained from Mayor\\nBarnes, of Granville, who as mayor of a municipality of\\nLicking County has power to act. More than two score\\nsecret service men were sworn in as deputies and proceeded\\nto Newark, under the Search and Seizure law, to make the\\narrests and take possession of whatever goods were found.\\nNewark‚Äôs Black Friday\\nThe special officers met at the court house in Newark on\\nFriday morning, July 8. There they were divided into three\\nsquads for the purpose of raiding three of the worst sa\\nloons‚ÄîBolton‚Äôs, Henry‚Äôs and the Bismark. The officers\\nhad hardly reached Newark before the saloons were given\\nthe tip.\\nThe raids were made a few minutes after eleven o‚Äôclock\\nFriday morning. At each place a mob assembled. No effort\\nwas made by the police to disperse the crowds, which were\\nsoon inflamed by free liquor. An appeal was made to Mayor\\nAtherton to take action looking to the suppression of possi\\nble trouble, but the mayor, apparently unconcerned, refused;\\nin fact, if credence can be given to reports, his attitude was\\none of encouragement to the lawless spirit.\\nTrouble Starts Early\\nAt Bolton‚Äôs saloon, while a special officer was serving\\nthe warrant he was struck on the head by an attache of\\nthe place and received such a severe wound from a pair of\\nbrass knuckles that it required eight stitches to sew it up.\\nWith a howling, threatening mob on the outside, the officers\\nfought with and subdued those in charge, and, leaving two\\nof the men to hold the place, the others took their prisoners\\nto the court house. One prisoner was released and the other\\nwas refused outright, but the secret service officers were\\nordered from the building.\\nIn the meantime, the two officers in Bolton‚Äôs saloon were\\nbesieged by a mob of several hundred infuriated men, which\\nthe police made no effort to disperse. Windows were broken\\nand dire threats were made. Shots were fired into the\\nbuilding by the crowd. The officers fired several shots into\\nthe floor and walls to scare the mob, and finally a member\\nof the mob threw dynamite into the building, with the re\\nsult that the entire front was demolished. The two secret\\nservice men took their departure through a rear door and,\\nafter being pursued into the country for several miles', made\\ntheir escape.\\nAt the Bismark those in charge of the saloon were placed\\nunder arrest. Officers were left in charge of the saloon to\\nguard the stock. Here, as at Bolton‚Äôs a threatening mob\\ngathered. Finally the chief of police of Newark came to\\nthe door of the Bismark and asked one of the secret service\\nmen what they were doing. The officer informed the chief\\nlie had a search warrant and showed it. The chief said\\nthey had no business there, left and soon returned with a\\npatrol wagon, arrested the secret service men on a charge\\nof assault and battery and locked them up in the city prison,\\nto which place they were followed by the mob.\\nAt Henry‚Äôs saloon practically the same scenes were en\\nacted. The officers were driven from the place by the liquor\\ninflamed crowd, and three of the officers boarded a city car,\\nexpecting to get an interurban car at the ball park and\\nleave town. At the ball park a crowd of forty or fifty men\\nhad gathered. Two of the officers succeeded in getting the\\ncar out of town, but Special Officer Etherington was pur\\nsued by the mob and ran for his life. Stones were thrown\\nat him and the cry went up to lynch him. He was caught\\nby a saloonkeeper named Howard who, according to eye\\nwitnesses, struck him over the head with a blackjack and\\nwas holding him until the mob could reach him. It was\\nat this‚Äô time that Etherington released his hands, drew his\\nrevolver and shot Howard. Howard died about eight o‚Äôclock\\nthat evening.

He was\\nallowed to be given into the hands of\\nthe mob only after the flames and\\nsmoke imperilled the lives of all the\\nprisoners, numbering 130, Sheriff\\nClark and his deputies, ond other of\\nficials who were defending the jail.\\nWajyor Ed P. Smith was hanged and\\nwounded and almost miraculously es\\ncaped death at the hands of the fren\\nzied mob. The court house was burned,\\none white man was shot and killed,\\nand two since have died from wounds,\\nand scores were wounded, including\\ntwenty-one policemen.\\nPrompt, Vigorous Action Needed.\\nIf vigorous action had been taken\\nwhen the mob, composed chiefly of\\nboys and youths, began to asesmble\\nat 2:30 in the afternoon the awful\\norgy of Sunday night would not have\\nbeen. The supposed impregnable posi\\ntion of the county jail and the appar\\nent impossibility of getting any pris-j\\noner out of it, unless he were volun\\ntarily given up, of which no one be\\nlieved there was the remotest pos\\nsibility, may account for the apparent\\nleniency with which the police author\\nities regarded the incipient mob. Fail\\nure to stop things at the start proved\\nf a costly mistake.\\nWhen the Mob Started.\\nAbout 2s30 Sunday afternoon a\\ncrowd numbering less than 100, and\\ncomposed mainly of boys and youths\\nranging in age from 12 to 20, as\\nsembled on the south side of the court\\nhouse and boasted that they had come\\n\"to get the nigger.‚Äù There was no\\nleader among them and few, if any of\\nthem, were armed. This crowd was\\ngradually increased until at about 5\\no‚Äôclock the mob, for it was now\\' as\\nsuming this temper, approached the\\ndoor of the court house and began\\nto break windows. The police drove\\nthem back. Leaders began to appear\\nin the crowd and direct the attack on\\nthe county building. Securing a heavy\\nplank the mob surged forward and\\nbroke down the massive doors. The(\\nfew police opposing them turned on\\nthe hose and they were again driven\\nback. Arming themselves with stones\\nand brick the moh charged the po\\nlice who took refuge within the build-!\\ning, without firing a single shot in\\ntheir defense. The moh continued to\\nincrease in numbers, while thousands i\\nof spectators lined the streets.\\nMob Begins to Show Frenzy.\\nA little before 6 o‚Äôclock members\\nof the mob entered the building. They\\nwere met with a fusillade of shots j\\nfrom the police. Chief of Police Eb\\nerstein attempted to talk to the moh\\nurging them to let the law take its\\ncourse. He was hooted down and a\\nbrick whizzed near his head. The\\nlives of others who attempted to talk\\nto the irrational beast‚Äîfor that is\\nwhat a mob is‚Äînearly paid for it\\nwith their lives. Among those who\\nwere attacked and iniured was Com\\n**\\' missioner Harry B. Zimman. When\\nEberstein pleaded that the man be\\ngiven a trial; the mob shouted:\\n‚ÄúHand him over to us, we‚Äôll give\\nhim a trial. We don‚Äôt want any talk\\nfrom you, we want that nigger.\"\\nWhen Zimman appealed to them,\\nsome one shouted: ‚ÄúLynch the damn\\nJew; he can make Mayor Smith give\\nup the nigger.‚Äô Members of the mob\\npummelled him and he protesting was\\nhurried by friends hack into his of\\nfice.\\nAs night began to fall the frenzy\\nof the mob increased. Mayor Smith,\\nCommissioner Ringer and Chief Eb\\nerstein, who had gained entrance to\\nthe jail, were with Sheriff Clarke and\\nk his deputies and the inadequate force\\nof police, battling to defend the pris\\noner and the county‚Äôs property.\\nPolice Driven Back.\\nThe mob drove the police to the\\nsecond floor of the court house. Am\\nmonia bombs were hurled into the\\nmob to prevent their reaching the\\nfloor. But while the defenders were\\nbusy the increasing mob without was\\nactive. Ladders were secured and\\nthey began to scale the walls and en\\ntered the building through battered\\nin windows.\\nSomeone suggested that Brown had\\nbeen secretly removed to the city\\njail.\\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go there and see,‚Äù yelled half\\na dozen men.\\nFive Men Search City Jail.\\nCaptain of.Police Heitfeld allowed\\nfive members of the crowd to search\\nthe jail. The man wanted was not\\nfound. The men reported this to the\\nothers. Then the men returned to the\\ncourt house.\\nIt was not until about 8 p. m.\\nthat the crowd started its violence.\\nBy this time every street around\\nthe building was literally crowded\\nwith people. Some estimated the num\\nber at 25,000.\\nWith a few policemen stationed on\\nthe second floor, every advance of\\nthe crowd was met with a fusillade of\\nbullets.\\nInjured men were carried out by\\ntheir comrades.\\nContinual shooting on the inside,\\ninstead of frightening the crowd,\\nseemed only to increase its fury.\\n‚ÄúWhat we need is some weapons,‚Äù\\nyelled an excited man.\\nGuns Looted From Stores.\\nAlmost instantly several hundred\\nmen ran to the Walter G. Clark and\\nthe Townsend Gun company stores.\\nDoors were smashed in and every\\nweapon in sight, from a small .22\\ncaliber to high-powered rifles were\\ntaken. Large quantities of ammuni\\ntion also were confiscated.\\nCourt House Is Set Afire.\\nAnother portion of the crowd had\\nobtained a large quantity of gasoline,\\nwhich it poured on the first floor of\\nthe court house. It was ignited, and\\na mighty shout went up from the\\ncrowd as the blaze gained headway.\\nAmerican flags were waved and the\\ncrowd went wild.\\nHundreds of shots were fired into\\nevery window. A head seen any place\\nin the building brought forth a shower\\nof bullets.\\nA blaze broke out on the fourth\\nfloor, and the crowd again yelled itself\\nhoarse.\\nNone Allowed to Leave Building.\\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get the nigger if we have to\\nburn the whole shack down,‚Äù yelled\\na man as he jumped on a truck in\\nHarney street.\\n‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs do this thing proper,\"\\nhe went on. \"Don‚Äôt allow a soul to\\nleave this building until we get the\\nnigger.\"\\nMen with rifles, shotguns and re-^\\nvolvers were stationed at every door.\\nMayor Beaten by Crowd.\\nMayor Smith, who had been up\\nstairs with the squad of policemer\\nattempted to leave through the east\\nentrance. One of the vigilant watch\\ners spied and recognized him.\\n‚ÄúThere\\'s Mayor Smith,‚Äù he cried.\\nmm t < i r i\\nThe Hon. Kd P. Smith, Omaha\\'s Heroic Mayor, Who Nearly Lost His Lifcf\\nSunday Nij{ht Because of His Stand for Law and Order and His Firm\\nRefusal to Turn Over Prisoner to Mob.\\nexecutive.\\n‚ÄúHe can give us the nigger if he j\\nwill and save the courthouse,‚Äù a man\\ncried.\\nA dozen blows landed on the may\\nor‚Äôs head, and he fell to the ground.\\nSeveral men jumped upon him, but\\nhe was picked up by several friends,\\nwho attempted to get him away.\\nTry to Hang Mayor.\\n‚ÄúDon\\'t let them get Mayor Smith\\naway,‚Äù yelled a husky youth.\\n‚Äúbet‚Äôs string him up. Shoot him.\\nHe‚Äôs a negro-lover. They elected him.\\nHe‚Äôs no better than they are!‚Äù\\nHatless and covered with hlood, the\\nm or faced his attackers.\\n‚ÄúNo, I won‚Äôt give up the man,‚Äù he\\ncried. \"I‚Äôm going to enforce the law,\\n;en with my own life.‚Äù\\nThe mayor was jostled down Har\\nney street until an electric light pole\\nwas reached. The crowd dropped a\\nnoose around his neck and threw the\\nend of the rope over the iron beam.\\nCuts Rope and Saves Mayor.\\nThen an unidentified, well-dressed\\nman cut the rope as it was being\\ndrawn tight. He disappeared before\\nthe crowd had time to catch him.\\nAnother man, a friend of Mayor\\nSmith‚Äôs, argued with the crowd.\\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a white man,‚Äù he pleaded.\\n\"For God‚Äôs sake use a little judgment.\\nDon\\'t do something you‚Äôll be sorry for.\\nDon‚Äôt be bolsheviki.‚Äù\\nThe crowd listened for a moment.\\nThen it started to resume its work.\\nThe delay probably saved Mayor\\nSmith‚Äôs life. In the few minutes\\'\\npause police reinforcements arrived,\\nand officers with drawn pistols,\\nformed a ring about the mayor and\\nhe was hustled away.\\nIt was done so quickly that the\\ncrowd hardly realized that its intend\\ned victim was gone. Then its angel\\ndoubled.\\nThe police car, standing near, was\\n(Continued on Page 2.)\\nMONITOR EDITOR\\nMAKES STATEMENT\\nDeclares That a Determined and Seri,\\nous Effort Ought to Have Been\\n-Made By Police to Disperse Crowd\\nat Beginning.\\nCOMMENDS MAYOR SMITH‚ÄôS\\nHEROIC STAND FOR LAW\\nCharges Sensational Reports of Crime\\nin Press Chiefly Responsible for\\nLynchings and Race Riots; Time for\\nCool Heads and Sane Counsel.\\nTHE Rev. John Albert Williams,\\nrector of St. Philip‚Äôs Episcopal\\nchurch, president of the local branch\\nof the National Association for the\\nAdvancement of Colored People and\\neditor of The Monitor, was requested\\nby the Omaha Bee to furnish it a\\nstatement concerning the mob violence\\nof Sunday. The following statement\\nwas given that publication:\\n‚ÄúI am humiliated almost beyond ex\\npression that Omaha yesterday let slip\\nher opportunity of demonstrating that\\nhere is at least one city where the\\nforces of law and order are supreme\\nover mobocracy, anarchy and vandal\\nism. This opportunity passed when\\nthe police authorities made no serious\\nattempt to disperse the mob at the\\nvery beginning, and again when fail\\ning here there was questionable delay\\nin getting the federal troops on the\\nground to protect the jail. This out\\nbreak Is, unfortunately, symptomatic\\nand impresses many of us as being\\npart of a well planned propaganda to\\nstir up strife between American citi\\nzens. This spirit is fostered, encour\\naged and nourished by the disposition\\nof the press generally to play up in\\nscare-crow sensational headlines the\\nrace of alleged criminals when they\\nare Negroes. This is a reprehensible\\nthing to which can largely be traced\\nevery lynching in this country.\\n‚ÄúThe action of Mayor Smith and j\\nothers was heroic. The fate of these j\\nsplendid men should be a solemn j\\nwarning for the suppression and dis-1\\npersion of mobs at the beginning.\\'\\nThese are times for cool heads and!\\nsane counsel. The Colored citizens of j\\nOmaha took no part in last night‚Äôs\\norgy. They wisely remained at home, [\\nprepared to defend their homes and\\nloved ones to the last ditch. They will\\nbe found on the side of law and ordei\\nand ask only that they be protected.\\nAll citizens, white and black, must de\\nplore the awful blot that has been cast;\\nupon Omaha by this mob murder.‚Äù\\nGUARD FOR MAYOR\\nA detail of fifteen soldiers, under (\\ncommand of Lieutenant Thomas Chris\\ntian of Fort Crook, was sent at 1\\no‚Äôclock Monday to the Ford hospital,\\nwhere they have been stationed as a\\nguard for Mayor Smith, who is being\\ncared for at the hospital.\\n. ‚ñ† ii i‚Äîhi ii i.rniT\\'TT\\'i ‚ÄîruilMll\\nActive Mob and Spectators Numbering More Than 5,000 on North Side of Court House Late Sunday Afternoon.\\nRIOTERS ARRESTED\\nFACE SERIOUS CHARGES\\nHusband of Woman Assassinated\\nTwo Years Ago, Under Arrest‚Äî\\nMurder and Arson Charges to Be\\nFiled.\\nBONDS ARE REFUSED BY\\nFEDERAL AUTHORITIES\\nSpecial Session of County Grand Jury\\nCalled October 8 to Investigate and\\nIndict Persons Implicated in Riot.\\nUnder orders of military authori\\nties, police have arrested 55 men dur\\ning the past two days for complicity\\nin Sunday night‚Äôs riot.

The offi\\ncers wi)h their prisoner took refuge\\nin the city building, barricading\\nthemselves behind the doors of one\\nof the offices. They could not check\\n; the mob, however, for\" it secured a\\nlong pole and battered down a sec\\ntion of the wall and door, both of\\nwhich were frail.

In the mean\\ntime, the police arrested all the secret service officers they\\ncould find and locked them up in the city prison on the\\ncharge of assault and battery.\\nThat the police shared the feeling of the mob was evident\\nfrom their action towards' the secret service officers whom\\nthey arrested. ‚ÄúIf I were not wearing a uniform, I would\\n‚Äòget you,‚Äô ‚Äù was the remark made to one of the officers by\\na policeman who was taking him to prison. Bear in mind,\\nthe special officers were fully authorized by law to do every\\nthing that was done in Newark that day.\\nWith the encouraged mobs in control of the town from\\neleven o‚Äôclock in the morning, nothing was done by Mayor\\nAtherton or Sheriff Linke to quell disturbance or preserve\\norder. The saloons continued at full blast distributing drinks\\nand liquor; it had the natural effect on the excited, lawless\\nelement. A company of state troops is located at Newark,\\nbut no demand was made for their services; neither did the\\nsheriff nor the mayor appeal to the governor for assistance.\\nThe local police did not raise a hand to disperse the crowds\\nand restore order. The sheriff left his office in the after\\nnoon and did not return until later in the evening. The\\nlawless forces reigned supreme and did .not expect or fear\\ninterference from sheriff or mayor.\\nThe Mob Gathers\\nEarly in the evening a large crowd gathered about the\\njail, clamoring for the life of Etherington. This crowd was\\nnot ordered to disperse. Mayor Atherton was so uncon\\ncerned that he attended a summer theater and later came\\ndown to the jail. By that time, Howard had died and the\\nmob, frenzied by drink and with that utter senselessness\\nwhich always characterizes such an assemblage, was ve\\nhemently demanding that Etherington be turned over to\\nit to be lynched. And yet, neither the sheriff nor the mayor\\nasked the governor for aid.\\nMayor Atherton tried to make a speech to the mob, ask\\ning it to disperse, but the crowd simply laughed at him and\\ntreated him as a joke. After making his little speech, Mayor\\nAtherton left the mob in control of the situation and went\\nhome and to bed leaving his town to the mercy of the law\\nless element.\\nThe Sheriff Unconcerned\\nSheriff Linke was apparently as unconcerned as Mayor\\nAtherton; aside from swearing in an extra deputy or two,\\nhe did nothing. He made no appeal. He made no show of\\nforce, even when iron rails and a telegraph pole were brought\\nto batter down the doors of the jail, he offered no resistance.\\nNot a shot was fired. He did not give up the keys, but he\\ndid not have them, as they were in the possession of the\\ndeputy. At 10:20 a deputy sheriff telephoned to the gov\\nernor‚Äôs office for troops. The governor‚Äôs secretary and the\\nadjutant general were awaiting such a demand, had cars\\nin readiness and could have had state troops in Newark in\\nan hour‚Äôs time. Ten minutes later the sheriff rescinded the\\norder for troops for within those ten minutes the mob had\\nbattered down the doors, had secured Officer Etherington,\\nhad dragged him to Court House Square, had brutally as\\nsaulted him, had, in fact, actually killed him with a blow\\non the head by a piece of iron and afterwards hanged his\\nbody to a telephone pole.\\nEtherington‚Äôs Last Words\\nBefore given the blow which rendered the young nuin\\nunconscious, if it did not kill him, Pltherington was asked\\nif he wanted to say anything. The young officer replied,\\nJ ell my mother that I died in the performance of my\\nduty,‚Äù and so the life of an officer of the law was taken\\nhy the lawless saloon element of Newark while the mayor\\nslept in his home and the sheriff refused to act in the officer‚Äôs\\nbehalf.\\nBoth Mayor Atherton and Sheriff Linke, in published\\nstatements, declare that while they saw the mob and the\\nmayor addressed it, and that while no member of the mob\\nwore a mask, they did not recognize a single man, woman\\nor child. Be it remembered, the whole affair took place\\nunder the glare of electric lamps. This evident desire to\\ndodge responsibility gives an index to the make-up of the\\ntwo men.\\nThere were probably 5,000 persons in the mob, many of\\nthem women and children. Those who saw it declare that\\ncomparatively few were active, and, as Adjutant General\\nWeybrecht expressed it, having made a careful investiga\\ntion, ‚ÄúOne resolute official could have prevented the lynch\\ning.‚Äù In fact, in the adjutant general‚Äôs report to Governor\\nHarmon, it is set forth that not a Licking County official\\nwas even ‚Äúmussed up‚Äù in attempting to stop the mob, and\\nthat troops easily could have been put into Newark hours\\nin advance of the lynching. The more serious' charge is\\nmade that both the sheriff and the mayor openly sympa\\nthized with the mob.\\nInfluence of Bolton\\nTo show the hold the saloon element has on Newark, when\\none of the secret service officers who was struck over the\\neye hy an attache of one of the saloons which was raided\\nwent to a leading hotel of the city and asked for a room\\nthat he might wash the blood from his face, he was followed\\nby saloonkeeper Bolton who ordered the hotel clerk not to\\nlet the officer have a room in the house. The clerk obeyed\\nBolton‚Äôs command, and the officer was turned away.\\nThere is a strong band between the saloonkeepers and\\nsome of the politicians of Newark. The organ of this com\\nbination is the Advocate, edited by ,T. IT. Newton, who\\naspires to be the political boss of the town, and whose claim\\nto the place is not seriously contradicted. Even the de\\nplorable work of the mob did not cause the Advocate to\\ncensure the derelict officers. On the contrary. Editor New\\nton tried to divert attention from them by laving the blame\\non the secret service men. In an editorial on the day fol\\nlowing the lynching of Etherington, the Advocate said:\\nThe deplorable consequences of yesterday and last\\nnight show that it is not wise nor prudent to Inflame\\npublic sentiment. It is to the credit of Newark people\\nthat no citizen of Newark had anything to do with\\nthe search and seizure efforts by the foreign ‚Äúdry‚Äù\\ndetectives.\\nIf it had not been for the interference of non\\nresidents, Newark today would not be disgraced in the\\neyes of the people of the state of Ohio.\\nThis is untruthful and cowardly, the secret service officers\\nwere acting entirely within the law.

J\\nVol. XVI.‚ÄîNo. 6\\nI Judge Lynch and Ris methods.\\nJUDGE Lynch sends yearly more\\nmen to that ‚Äúundiscovered coun\\ntry, from whose bourne no trav-\\neler returns,‚Äù than any other\\njudge. The days on which the news\\npapers do not give an account of a\\nlynching bee In some part of this great\\nand glorious country ‚Äúare few and far\\nbetween.‚Äù While Judge Lynch finds\\nthe south particularly congenial to his\\npeculiar way of redressing real or fan\\ncied wrongs, and is in fact in such\\ngreat request there that he sometimes\\nfinds it necessary to divide himself and\\nappear in two or more places at one\\nand the same time, yet occasionally he\\nis prevailed upon to leave the land of\\ncotton and coons, to hold his court in\\nthe hyperborean regions of Michigan\\nand Montana; or in the confines of the\\nwild and woolly west; or under the\\nbuckeye trees that grow on the banks\\nof the Ohio, the Miami, the Cuyahoga\\nand their tributaries; or in almost any\\nother part of Uncle Sam‚Äôs dominion\\nbetween the Atlantic and Pacific\\noceans. Our colonial possessions have\\nas yet not reached that stage of enlight\\nenment necessary to appreciate the\\nbenign influence of Judge Lynch‚Äôs de\\ncisions‚Äîthe mere‚Äôs the pity!\\nThe origin of Judge Lynch seems to\\nbe shrouded in darkness. Several con\\ntradictory opinions concerning his ori\\ngin have from time to time been pro\\nmulgated by different learned dissem\\ninators of antiquarian lore, but they\\nall fall outside the sacred circle of prob\\nabilities. We are under the necessity\\nto content ourselves with Judge Lynch\\nas we find him. He is amongst us‚Äî\\ncannot be denied; his decisions are as\\nthe decisions of the kings of the Medes\\nand Persians of old‚Äîirrevocable. He\\nfrequently makes mistakes and dooms\\nthe wrong man, but what of it? He\\nmakes no pretension to infallibility,\\nand his services seem to be as much\\nin demand as ever.\\nLynching is resorted to by ungov\\nernable mobs of brutes who generally\\n-call themselves the ‚Äúbest‚Äù citizens of\\nthe community wherein a lynching\\ntakes place. These best citizens take\\nit upon themselves to pronounce a\\nhuman being‚Äîa man and brother‚Äî\\nguilty of a crime without the least for\\nmality of a trial, and frequently upon\\nthe unsupported testimony of a woman\\nwho, had she lived in Caesar‚Äôs time,\\nwould never have been in danger of\\nbecoming Mrs. Caesar. Or the best cit\\nizens suspect some one of having com\\nmitted a murder, or stolen a horse, or\\nrobbed a house, or store, or chicken\\n<joop, or melon-patch; or of having\\nburned a barn, or house, or haystack,\\nnr strawstack, etc., and if the unhappy\\nwretch suspected cannot there and\\nthen prove to the satisfaction of all\\nthat he could not have beeh a party to\\nthe crime, the most respectable mob\\nwill pronounce him guilty and execute\\nhim on the spot.\\nBut supposing the man under suspi\\ncion to be guilty of any of the afore\\nmentioned crimes, or all of them, the\\ntotality of the evil results of his crim\\ninality sinks into insignificance when\\ncompared with the evil consequences\\nthat follow the taking of a human life\\nby a mob and without due process of\\nlaw. The commission of a heinous\\ncrime shocks us and awakens in us\\nfeelings of indignation? but the taking\\naway of human life by an irresponsible\\nand ungovernable mob, with all its at\\ntending barbarities, has a brutalizing\\neffect upon the whole community.\\nAnd again, the guilty wretch may have\\nbeen irritated, or provoked, or driven\\nby necessity, or otherwise sorely\\ntempted to commit his crime; but if\\nthe yielding to temptation is reprehen\\nsible in an individual, how much more\\nis this true of a mob which perhaps\\nnumbers thousands!\\nSTILLWATER, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, AUGUST 28, 1902.\\nJudging the enormity of a crime by\\nthe evil results that can be ascribed to\\nthe commission of such crime, it seems\\nthat treason, political bribery and the\\nperpetrating of a premeditated murder\\nby a mob outrank all other crimes.\\nThe traitor by his treason may cause\\nthe death of thousands of his country\\nmen, or the loss of their political lib\\nerty; the political briber may frustrate\\nthe will of the people and prevent the\\nadoption of measures tending to the\\nwelfare of the people, or willfully and\\nknowingly impose laws Whose tenden\\ncies are productive of injury to the\\npeople. In both these cases it is the\\ncrime of one, or a few, that brings mis\\nfortune and loss to the many, but in a\\ncase of lynching I *it is the crime of the\\nmultitude that brings sudden and irre\\nmediable injury to one person and at\\nthe same time lowers the standard of\\nmorality of all the partakers in the\\ncrime and all who shield them or sym\\npathize with them. Nor is this all; the\\nminds of the children of the lynchers,\\nor of the defenders of lynchers, will be\\nimpressed with the idea that under\\ncertain conditions a crime committed\\nby a mob is justifiable and even com\\nmendable; and as the notions which\\nchildren derive from their parents are\\nthe hardest to eradicate, it follows that\\nif the father is a defender of lynch law\\nthe son will most likely be a defender\\nof lynch Jaw also. Thus the evil per\\npetuates itself.\\nNo thoughtful person can look upon\\nthe wide-spread moral obliqueness in\\ndicated by lynch law with indifference.\\nThere is no excuse for lynch law. The\\nexcuse so often offered, that the course\\nof justice is slow and uncertain, is\\nwholly at variance with the facts. In\\nthe south, for instance, it would be\\ndifficult to select a jury that would\\nfail to adequately punish the lustful\\nor murderous brute who now falls a\\nvictim to the lynch law. And through\\nout the whole United States it is only\\nthe very rich who have the power or\\nprivilege to delay the course of justice.\\nYet how seldom do we hear of a rich\\nman being lynched! Furthermore, lynch\\nlaw is inexcusable on the ground that it\\nexerts no restraining influence upon the\\ncriminally inclined. For decades men\\naccused of certain crimes have been\\nburned at the stake, hung, shot, buried\\nalive, or torn to pieces by infuriated\\nmobs; yet the commission of such\\ncrimes has not decreased, and to the\\nstudent of sociology it is as clear as\\nanything can be on this terrestial ball\\nthat the commission of such crimes\\nwill not decrease as long as the present\\nmeans are made use of to extirpate\\ncrime.\\nViolence begets violence.\\nDisrespect for law and order propa\\ngates itself.\\nIf a man were to try to subdue a con\\nflagration by adding inflammable mat\\nter, such as petroleum or bitumen, to the\\nflames he would be considered no better\\nthan a fool; yet lynchers are ever try\\ning to subdue crime by committing\\nthe greatest of all crimes; for the evil\\nresults that follow lynch law far out\\nweigh the evil results of the most hei\\nnous crime ever committed by beast\\nin human form, who becomes a victim\\nof Judge Lynch.\\nThe dogma which serves as a founda-\\ntion upon which Judge Lynch built\\nhis judicial structure is repugnant to\\nevery justice loving man or woman of\\nthis or any civilized country. The\\nVlogma amounts to about this; Under\\ncertain conditions any number of\\nmen‚Äîsay a number large enough to\\noverpower the sheriff and his deputies\\n‚Äîhave a right to take a fellow man\\nand do unto him as they please. Now,\\nlet it be conceded that the majority of\\nthe victims of lynch law are accused of\\nhaving committed atrocious crimes,\\n‚ÄúIT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND.‚Äù\\nsuch as Willful murder or the violation\\nof the person of a female, and that\\nsuch crimes are considered in the com\\nmunity where they\\'are perpetrated to\\nbe the most monstrous crimes imagi\\nnable, and that therefore it is justifiable\\nto deprive the person accused of such\\ncrimes of his life, or subject him to\\ntorture, without due process of law;\\nthen it follows that in other communi\\nties, where horse stealing, or dog steal\\ning, or cat stealing, or profane swear\\ning, or drunkenness, are looked upon\\nas the greatest crimes imaginable, it\\nwould be justifiable likewise to deprive\\nthe person accused of any of the above\\nnamed crimes of his life without due\\nprocess of law. Thus the best citizen\\nof South Carolina who believes in lynch\\ning a black man, or a man accused of\\nmurder or rape, would have no just\\ngrounds for complaint if he were to\\nreceive word that his son had been\\nlynched in Indiana because somebody\\naccused him of horse stealing; and the\\nrespectable citizen of Indiana who be\\nlieves in lynchi√üg suspected horse\\nthieves should ma~ke no outcry when\\ninformed that his son had been lynched\\nin Boston on the accusation of an old\\nmaid of having stolen her pet cat.\\nIt seems probable that lynch law was\\nfirst adopted by a people thinly scat\\ntered over a large territory, on account\\nof its expediency. But like many oth\\ner evils which at first are resorted to\\nonly because they ars expedient, but\\nin time become habits which we find\\nit hard to break away from, so lynch\\nlaw has from a matter of expediency\\ngrown into a habit, and from present\\nindications it would seem that we are\\nnot even trying to shake it off. We\\nshould take warning from this. As\\nindividuals or ava nation, we have no\\nright to adopt measures merely be\\ncause they are expedient. ‚ÄúExpediency‚Äù\\nhas ever been the watchword of cow\\nards. TLemistocles the Athenian,\\nwho conceived the idea of stealing the\\nSpartan‚Äôs fleet, because from the\\nAthenian point of view it would be\\nexpedient, was morally a coward\\nAnd the so-called statesmen of this or\\ncountry who are continually ad\\nvocating measures because they are\\nexpedient, and who lack the moral\\ncourage to tear down this Chinese wall,\\nExpediency, and gaze upon the beauti\\nful realms of Justice which lie beyond,\\nare but followers of the unscrupulous\\nAthenian.\\nThe soul of every true lover of his\\ncountry is filled with disgust when the\\nnewspapers inform him how another\\nvictim of Judge Lynch has been tor\\ntured to death. The blush of shame\\nspreads over the countenance of the\\nright-minded patriot when he hears of\\na fresh case of mob rule triumphing\\nover law and order. We are told every\\nday by men who ought to know better\\nthat we are the greatest nation under\\nthe sun. If we could but realize that\\ntrue national greatness is not indicated\\n‚Äúby expansion of trade and wealth, of\\ninvention of new machinery, and of\\ndiscoveries of new resources of the\\nearth,‚Äù or by the acquisition of new\\nterritories, the planting of our flag on\\nthe isles of the sea, but is compatible\\nonly with moral progress, the love of\\ntruth for truth‚Äôs sake, the doing of\\nright for right‚Äôs sake‚Äîwhat a truly\\ngreat and happy nation we might be\\ncome in time! But as long as we tol\\nerate lynch law, or mob rule Tn any\\nform, or deny to the meanest individual\\nthe protection of the law, it is absurd\\nto lay claim to national To\\nbecome truly great we must learn to\\nsubdue our passions, to respect the\\nlaws which ourselves through our rep\\nresentatives have made, to concede to\\nothers, without distinction, the rights\\nand privileges which we demand for\\nourselves; and we must ever bear in\\nmind that ‚Äúa high intellectual develop\\nment, without a corresponding growth\\nof morality, is a curse to mankind.‚Äù\\nH.

With us this balance seems to\\noscillate when it is not clearly in favor\\nof murderers and thieves.. What does\\nthis discrepancy signify‚Äîwhat is the\\ncause of it? Many ancient problems,\\nsocial and others, tried for centuries in\\nthe old world and then tried in the\\ndifferent conditions of the new world,\\nhave shown, as has been often noted, a\\nwonderful tendency to variation in\\nresults on this side of the sea. Take\\nthe jury system, for instance, as seen\\nin England, and seen here. It is a\\nsplendid machinery for conviction in a\\ncountry whqje twelve ordinary men\\nwill sit quietly in court for a certain\\nnumber of hours and at the end of that\\ntime decide all questions just as tome\\nauthority tells them they must; it fails\\nwhere every one of these men has his\\nown opinion.‚Äù\\nThe American detective system is\\nharshly rated for this state of affairs,\\nbut the detectives and police generally\\nare not so much accountable for the\\ndiscrepancy as at first sight appears.\\nThe selfish attitude of the individual\\nmembers of the American nation in\\nany given case, is more frequently than\\nany other the real cause of the police\\nfailing to convict that particular of\\nfender. Englishmen may be equally\\nselfish, but they display much more\\nfar-sightedness in the attitude adopted\\nby them in similar cases. This may\\nbest be demonstrated by illustration.\\nLet us suppose a man to .be assaulted\\nand the attack witnessed by a stranger.\\nIn England the stranger would at once\\noffer his right name and address to the\\naggrieved party and promise to render\\nhis services in bringing the offender to\\njustice, altho well aware that it would\\nentail some loss of time and possibly\\nexpense and annoyance. Here, how\\never, the witness would argue to him\\nself that he would be foolish to be\\ndragged into a matter that did not im\\nmediately concern him, and instead of\\ntendering his name he would try to\\nevade giving it, and might even go so\\nfar as to give a false one if. pressed.\\nIt is this same selfishness and entire\\ndisregard for one‚Äôs duty towards one‚Äôs\\nT ERMB* i *l.ooper year, In advance\\nitKWB.-j six Months so cents.\\nneighbor that is directly responsible\\nfor the enormous number of fake\\nshows and gigantic swindlers for small\\namounts that flourish in this country,\\nbut which would find themselves en\\ntirely lacking customers beyond the\\nfirst one or tw¬© in any of the old coun\\ntries. Here the victim of such an es\\ntablishment calculates his personal\\nfinancial interest in taking the trouble\\nto expose the fraud and the result of\\nsuch calculation is inevitable. Conse\\nquently he probably gets roped in about\\nonce a week on something of the kind\\nas regularly as clockwork. The public\\nseems to lose sight of the fact that the\\npolice are merely its servants employed\\nfor the express purpose of safeguard\\ning its interests; and instead of acting\\nas any other employer would when his\\nservant was not on hand or incapable\\nof doing the work alone and rendering\\nassistance, it stands aloof and scoffs.\\nAs for the jury system and the dis\\nparaging remarks applied to it‚Äîlet us\\nfirst consider whether the system in\\nvogue here is really the same as in\\nEngland before blaming it for not\\nworking smoothly. The objections\\nusually raised to the jury system on\\nthis side are practically all based on\\nthe instructions given the jury by the\\njudge and the willingness or unwilling\\nness of the several members of the jury\\nto follow those instructions.\\nNow there is this great difference\\nbetween the judge on the other- side\\nand the judge here: The former is ap\\npointed for life during good behavior\\nand the latter holds office for short\\nterms and is frequently pledged to a\\ndefinite course of action, and is always\\ndependent on the good will of certain\\nelectors in order to secure his re-elec\\ntion. When we consider that the in\\ndependence of the judiciary should be\\nthus secured was one of the most im\\nportant provisions of the English Peti\\ntion of Right and is still the abiding\\nfaith of all Englishmen, is it to be\\nwondered at that jurors on this side\\nfrequently eye askance the instructions\\ngiven them by judges who are not by\\nany means independent. E. G. A.\\nMan Who Named\\nAmerica. ,\\nFew Americans are aware of the fact\\nthat the name of their continent is due\\nto a German scholar. In 1507 Martin\\nWaldseemuller, also known as Hyla\\ncomylus, of St. Die, in the Vosges,\\nedited a book called ‚ÄúCosmographise\\nIntroductio,‚Äù in which he gave a trans\\nlation of Amerigo Vespucci‚Äôs descrip\\ntion of his voyages.\\nThat was just the time when Ameri\\ngo‚Äôs fame filled the world, while Colum\\nbus‚Äô disgrace overshadowed bis merit,\\nand evidently his name had never\\nreached the quiet village in the Vosges\\nwhen Amerigo trumpeted forth his own\\nglory.

If the policemen and sol\\ndiers had displayed the least bit of\\ncourage and bravery, and shot down\\nsome of the ring leaders of the mob,\\nwhile It was In front of Loper\\'s Cafe,\\nthat would have been the end of It,\\nand the reign of terror would have\\nceased.\\nBut they failed to stlko the iron\\nwhile it was hot, and the mob felt\\nthat it had full sway, would not be\\nmolested or interfered with, by the\\nofficers of the law. It roamed over\\nthe city, entering saloons, filling up\\nwith more whisky, setting fire to the\\nhomes and business places of Col\\nored people, brutally beating them up,\\ncompelling them to flee to save their\\nlives and the lives of their loved ones.\\nDuring this reign of terror and an\\narchy, the fire department was called\\nout and In a hf hearted manner, the\\nfiremen attempted to save the homes\\nof the Colored people from being burnt\\ndown over their heads. But as their\\nactions were displeasing to the mob,\\nthey desisted from doing so, whereas,\\nIT they had fearlessly discharged their\\nsworn duty, they would have turned\\nthe hose on the members of the mob\\nand driven them from the scene.

Deneen, through\\ncowardice and trembling fear of racial\\nprejudice flatly refused to order out\\nthe Eighth Regiment Illinois National\\nGuards, the only brave soldiers in\\nthis city who went to the front and\\nwere up against the real thing while\\ndoing military service In Cuba during\\nthe Spanish-American war, to protect\\nful ladies, who no doubt wanted to\\ncatch on to the soldiers, for this Is\\nleap year, a mob collected almost un\\nder the shadow of Gov.

Deneen\\ncould have ordered his soldiers to\\n\"shoot to kill\" for the purpose of su\\npressing the imps of hell, but it seems\\nhe failed to do so and the soldiers\\neither fired their guns up In the air\\nor down in the ground and the friend\\nly action on the part of the troops\\ntowards the members of the mob and\\ntheir undisputed right to destroy other\\nthe lives of the Negroes and their people\\'s property, simply encouraged\\nthe vengence of the\\nproperty from\\nmob.\\nThe first thing- that Gov. Deneen\\nshould have done would have been to\\nrush the Eighth Regiment Into the\\ndistrict wherein the majority of the\\nColored people resided, then they\\nwould have felt secure and they would\\nnot have been forced to flee In order\\nto save their lives. It Is \\'more than\\nself evident that the great majority\\nof the white soldiers in this state and\\nin most of the other states will never\\nhurt themselves while pretending to\\ndefend the life of a Negro, whether\\nhe is good or bad, for Gov. Deneen\\nordered troops from Chicago and\\nfrom all parts of the state, on\\nto Springfield and those that were\\nalready on the ground permitted\\nthe members of the mob to take their\\nguns from them and. lock them up in\\nthe armory, and many of the soldiers\\nwhile on their way to .the capital city\\nnut In their time in filling up on beer\\nand whisky and some of them did\\nnot hesitate in letting It be known\\nthat \"they were out for a good time\\nand were on their way to Springfield\\nto help to do up the \\'Niggers.\\'\\'\\nWith this bitter feeling down deep\\nin the hearts of many of the soldiers\\nagainst the Negro, or -Niggers,\\' as\\nmany of the troops referred to the\\nNegroes in a contemptlous manner, it\\nIs unreasonable to expect that they\\nwere eager to win anymore new med\\nals for risking their lives In an effort\\nto protect the life or property of any\\nNegro, for even after more than three\\nthousand white soldiers were march\\ning aroiod Sprlngfeld and iavisg a\\ngood time fa flirting with the beaatl-f\\nthem to continue on their holy mis\\nsions of murdering more Negroes, and\\nWilliam H.
